This may well work as a policy tool, but its political implications are fraught if this continues long-term. The Fed will essentially be paying more money to banks that were bailed out so that they won\u2019t lend to borrowers that need the money,\u201d explains a Journal editorial.\nGerald O\u2019Driscoll adds that the Fed not only has a problem of how to execute rate increases, but also why. Its interest rate moves are largely dictated by the unemployment rate, because of \u201cthe Fed\u2019s continued belief in the Phillips curve, the theory that there is an inverse relationship between the unemployment rate and the inflation rate.\u201d Yet the theory \u201chas been discredited by the work of numerous researchers,\u201d notes Mr. O\u2019Driscoll.

{"body": "Arista Networks Inc. won the first phase of an unusual legal battle that has transformed its two billionaire co-founders from partners into opponents.\nA judge in a California state court rejected claims by OptumSoft Inc. of ownership rights to software files created by Arista under a licensing agreement between the companies. The case is scheduled to continue over OptumSoft\u2019s allegation that Arista misappropriated trade secrets, a charge it has denied.\nArista, a Silicon Valley maker of switching equipment that went public in 2014, was co-founded in 2004 by well-known hardware designer  Andy Bechtolsheim and  David Cheriton, a Stanford University computer science professor. The two men, who had founded two previous companies together, also bolstered their personal fortunes as the first outside investors in Google Inc.\nMr. Cheriton around the same time founded OptumSoft, a company that created software for developing programs. Arista used that software in developing its products.\nThe dispute with OptumSoft emerged as Arista was preparing to go public. Mr. Cheriton stepped down from Arista\u2019s board in March 2014 and OptumSoft sued the company the next month. Though he no longer has direct involvement in Arista, a trust established by Mr. Cheriton for his children was reported as Arista\u2019s second-largest shareholder as of April, holding a 15% stake in the company with a current value of more than $720 million. Mr. Bechtolsheim\u2019s family held a 19% stake, according to an Arista proxy statement.\nA trial in the first phase of the suit was held in September, focusing on the language of a 2004 licensing agreement between the companies and whether Arista violated it.\nAccording to a proposed statement of findings by Santa Clara County Superior Court Judge  Peter Kerwin, the agreement gave Arista a free license to OptumSoft software, known as TACC, in exchange for any improvements, corrections or modifications it made to the software or \u201cderivative works.\u201d\nThe dispute hinged on whether a set of 114 software files created by Arista should be considered improvements to the OptumSoft software. The judge sided with Arista\u2019s contention that they shouldn\u2019t, under the language contained in the agreement. \u201cArista is entitled to a declaration it owns the disputed files,\u201d Judge Kerwin wrote.\nA trial over the trade-secret allegations in the suit is scheduled for 2016.\nThough it didn\u2019t discuss potential damage figures, Arista had described the stakes in the case as significant. If OptumSoft were able to prove that it owned major components of Arista\u2019s operating system, it could make them available to the company\u2019s competitors, Arista said in public filings.\n\u201cWe are pleased with Judge Kirwan\u2019s proposed statement of decision and appreciate the court\u2019s hard work in this case,\u201d said  Marc Taxay, vice president, general counsel for Arista Networks. \u201cArista is gratified that the Court recognized Arista\u2019s ownership of code it worked so hard to build.\u201d\nMr. Cheriton and lawyers representing OptumSoft didn\u2019t immediately respond to requests for comment.\nWrite to Don Clark at don.clark@wsj.com", "byline": "", "description": "Arista Networks Inc. won the first phase of an unusual legal battle that has transformed its two billionaire co-founders from partners into opponents.", "title": "Arista Wins First Phase of Unusual Lawsuit", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/arista-wins-first-phase-of-unusual-lawsuit-1450378275", "topics": ["Trade", "Foreign Policy/National Security"], "people": [], "orgs": ["Stanford University"], "election_confidence": 0.573486477749034, "authors": [{"author_id": 1558, "fullname": "don clark", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-12-17 21:35:51", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "967ab6e2768cd74b0e1054511e2b3a29", "date_access": "2015-12-17 21:50:13.531872"},

Ted Cruz over who is most faithful to conservative values is highlighting the divide in the party on how to balance privacy with the push for enhanced security. Seeking to position themselves as alternatives to current Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, the two candidates have traded increasingly sharp barbs, including during Tuesday\u2019s GOP debate in Las Vegas, over the best way to keep Americans safe. Mr. Rubio said Wednesday that Mr. Cruz talked tough against terrorism but has taken steps that weaken national security. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to stand up and say, \u2018I will destroy ISIS,\u2019\u201d he said on a campaign trip to Iowa. He also has said Mr. Cruz undermined U.S. intelligence capabilities by voting for legislation that ended a National Security Agency program to collect bulk telephone-call data of American citizens.\nMr. Cruz said Tuesday night that the USA Freedom Act he supported actually enhanced the government\u2019s law-enforcement powers, giving federal officials access to more telephone records than they did in the past. The two candidates, who rank second and third in many polls of GOP primary voters, also battled over their stances on illegal immigration. The Texas senator\u2014who in campaign literature calls himself \u201cthe only consistent conservative in the race\u201d\u2014has praised tough border-security proposals, such as an expanded wall on the border with Mexico, a signature proposal from Mr. Trump. Mr. Cruz also led the fight in the Senate against legislation that included a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants.\u00a0 Byron Tau and Damian Paletta report.\nMore on 2016: With Warren Buffett\u2019s blessing, Hillary Clinton said she would go beyond what President Barack Obama has proposed and push for a tax system that ensures the wealthiest Americans pay higher rates than middle-class households \u2026 Where the GOP candidates stand on\u00a0Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.\nLAURA MECKLER: HOW DEMOCRATS COULD WIN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2016\u2013REPORT\nTo win the presidency in 2016, Democrats must climb a steep hill: persuade Americans to keep them in power for a third straight term at a time of voter frustration at the status quo, heightened fear of terrorism and low approval ratings for outgoing President Barack Obama.

But the relentlessly low price of oil, the very phenomenon that paved the way for the political deal, also makes it unlikely that the impact\u2014whether the boon predicted by supporters or the disaster forecast by opponents\u2014will materialize soon. Rather, U.S. oil producers say the impact will come in the long term, as they find new markets, pump more oil and potentially hold down global fuel prices. Amy Harder and Erin Ailworth report.\nMASSIVE SPENDING AND TAX DEAL ADVANCES: \u00a0Congress struggled regularly this year just to keep the government operating. Then, early Wednesday, lawmakers in one fell swoop produced bills setting spending for fiscal 2016 that sweeps in hundreds of policy prescriptions and makes dozens of business and individual tax breaks permanent. The deal on the 2,009-page spending bill, reached shortly before 2 a.m. Wednesday, includes $1.15 trillion to fund the government through next September. It also contains policy prescriptions on issues from oil exports to sledding on Capitol Hill. The bill\u2019s most contentious provision would end a four-decade ban on oil exports, a major energy-policy shift long sought by Republicans and condemned by many House Democrats Wednesday. But their objections appeared unlikely to derail the legislation, as leaders coalesced around a sweeping agreement that excluded each side\u2019s most partisan demands. Kristina Peterson and Siobhan Hughes report.\nMore on the deal: The deal\u2019s changes to the 2010 health law come \u00a0with a relatively modest price tag. But both supporters and opponents of the provisions predict the deal will turn out to be a down payment on making them permanent\u2014and that would have much bigger ramifications \u2026 The bill would restrict the Securities and Exchange Commission from forcing public companies to disclose their political activities \u2026 Efforts to boost disclosure of political spending were dealt a blow by provisions in the spending bill \u00a0\u2026 The top Democrat in the House of Representatives called this week\u2019s major tax-cut deal \u201cpractically an immorality,\u201d but the top Democratic tax writer in the Senate called it a victory for millions of working families and college students \u2026 Congress is poised to pass a cybersecurity measure aimed at prompting businesses to share information on online threats, as lawmakers inserted the measure early Wednesday into a broad spending package expected to pass this week \u2026 The White House and congressional Democrats fell short in their bid to include a debt relief mechanism for Puerto Rico in the\u00a0federal spending bill but their effort produced the most concrete sign yet that lawmakers will eventually take up legislation addressing the island\u2019s debt crisis.\nFED RAISES RATES AFTER SEVEN YEARS NEAR ZERO, EXPECTS \u2018GRADUAL\u2019 TIGHTENING PATH: The Federal Reserve said it would end a seven-year experiment with near-zero interest rates by raising its benchmark rate and emphasizing a plan to lift it gradually over the next three years. The move marks a test of the economy\u2019s capacity to stand on its own with less central-bank support to spur continued spending and investment by households and businesses. Jon Hilsenrath and Ben Leubsdorf report.\nMore: The rate liftoff is giving a boost to U.S. stocks \u2026 The Federal Reserve interest-rate increase leaves unaddressed two riddles vexing investors: How healthy is the global economy, and how will markets react as U.S. monetary policy diverges from that of other large economies? \u2026 How Fed rates move markets \u2026 The Fed always knew its unprecedented campaign to boost employment could have unsavory side effects. As that campaign comes to an end, those side effects are making themselves felt \u2026 The Fed said it is boosting the size of a program it will use to set a floor under short-term interest rates as part of its effort to increase the cost of borrowing in the U.S. economy \u2026 We have liftoff.

For a good portion of it there were three Republican presidential candidates who, if you added up their polling numbers, had the support of more than half the voters\u2014and they had never, not one of them, won a political office in their lives. On-the-ground Republicans surveying the past 15 years of unwon wars, great recession, feeble recovery and a world on fire, thought: \u201cWho gave us this world? The professional political class. So it\u2019s time to reach outside politics and consider other kinds of experience and attainment.\u201d\nAnother wonder: The political parties swapped their longtime roles, styles and ways of being. The Democrats became the party of primogeniture, the Republicans of rebellion. The Democrats were once alive, chaotic and brawling, the Republicans staid and orderly. Not anymore. It is the Democrats who are accepting a coronation, the Republicans who said no to ancestral claims. The deflation of Jeb Bush is a huge story. With his failure to rise, the consultant class and shock-and-awe fundraising took it on the chin. Jeb was not the answer to any question the base was asking.\nIf the rise of  Donald Trump continues, the Republican Party is either breaking in two or changing its nature\u2014either way a huge political development. If it breaks in two it will be because the bottom pushed away hard from the top, which will have to decide where it goes. If the party holds together it will be a more populist one, at least as long as Mr. Trump dominates\u2014more liberal on spending, less interventionist on foreign policy, if we go by his rhetoric.\nMr. Trump is compared to Barry Goldwater in 1964 and George McGovern in 1972, but those comparisons are wrong in substance. Goldwater represented a clear, coherent but extreme conservatism, at least by the standards of the day; he pushed conservatism farther than the nation, including Republicans, wanted to go. McGovernism was experienced as pure, unadulterated left-liberalism\u2014philosophically coherent but extreme, and farther than the nation, including Democrats, wanted to go.\nMr. Trump is different. His views are not too far in one ideological direction; they go in no particular and every direction. His grab bag of stands, to give it its due, reflects a rough awareness of the historical and political moment we\u2019re in. But it\u2019s not a clear set of beliefs brought to their extreme, it\u2019s a bunch of beliefs brought forward by a man who bops to extremes and back again.\nCan he win the nomination? Yes. If the year has taught us anything it\u2019s that we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. He\u2019s leading in every primary state. Maybe that will change; maybe his deficit with women will turn out to matter. He could fail to win the Iowa caucuses in six weeks, which would leave him dinged. The past six months have been nothing but one headline: \u201cTrump is Winning.\u201d An Iowa loss would be \u201cTrump Loses!\u201d His mystique would be damaged and the damage could spread.\nOn the other hand he could triumph in New Hampshire, where he continues well ahead in the polls. And he could win that open primary with support from independents. (It is not only Republicans who would like to fire Washington.) In that case the headline would be \u201cTrump Expands the Base\u2014Trump Grows the Party!\u201d That would make Trumpism less easy to dismiss, more like a movement than a mood.\nDo Mr. and Mrs. Longtime Republican in the suburbs think a Trump victory would be a good or acceptable outcome? No? Then they\u2019d better get ready to press the viable non-Trump candidates to stay, and all others to leave. If after New Hampshire Mr. Trump is triumphing, Republican candidates who aren\u2019t going to make it should be pressed to sacrifice themselves to narrow the field and let the viable non-Trumps rise. Jeb Bush, by stepping down, could become what he wanted to be this year\u2014a hero, a history changer, a man who enhanced his own and his family\u2019s legacy.\nBut really, what a year. Nobody, not the most sophisticated expert watching politics up close all his life, knew or knows what\u2019s going to happen. Does it go to the convention? Do Mr. Trump\u2019s roarers turn out? Does he change history?\nAnd no one saw it coming.\nA last thought, on what we saw of the parties.\nThis week, about 18 million people watched the fifth Republican debate on CNN. It was the third-most-watched primary debate of all time. The first debate, on Fox News in August, broke all records with about 25 million viewers. All the debates in between were heavily watched. All featured fisticuffs, argument, real to-and-fro.\nThe Democrats in that time had two debates, with little fanfare, with a vibe of \u201cplease don\u2019t watch.\u201d It was less like public officials running for president than people in the witness protection program accidentally strolling onto a stage. In the second debate the stage was almost empty\u2014front-runner Hillary Clinton, an aged Vermont socialist with Einstein hair, and a fit young heartthrob with nothing to lose and nothing to say.\nThe Republicans are out there on every show and get cuffed about. They expose themselves to the scrum every day and take all comers. Mrs. Clinton considering interview requests is like a queen pointing at necklaces arrayed on a jeweler\u2019s pillow: \u201cI\u2019ll take that one, not that one. I\u2019ll think about that one.\u201d\nThe Republicans are finally, fitfully fighting out real issues\u2014ISIS, privacy. Mrs. Clinton is forced to fight no one, makes pronouncements and glides on.\nThe Republicans draw censure with their big, bodacious brawl. The Democrats should draw it for not struggling, grappling. The Republican Party was told to make Jeb king. No, they thundered. When the Democratic Party was asked to do a coronation, they pulled on their forelocks, bowed and said, \u201cYes, sire, may I do anything else?\u201d\nThis is not like the Democratic Party! It was once a big brass band marching through the streets\u2014loud, dissonant, there. \u201cI\u2019m not a member of any organized party,\u201d Will Rogers famously said. \u201cI\u2019m a Democrat.\u201d For generations Democrats repeated that line as a brag. They knew disorganized meant vital, creative, spontaneous, passionate\u2014alive.\nNow that party acts like this tidy, lifeless, fightless thing, a big, gray, dead-hearted, soul-killing blob. \u201cI have the demographics,\u201d it blobbily bellows, \u201cI have the millennials.\u201d Maybe it doesn\u2019t have as much as it thinks. It is no honor to the Democratic Party that it is not fighting things through with a stage full of contenders this epochal year.\nThe Republicans are all chaos and incoherence, it\u2019s true. But at least they\u2019re alive. At least they\u2019re fighting as if it matters.", "byline": "", "description": "A role reversal gives us rambunctious Republicans and deathly Democrats.", "title": "Primary Preview: The Brawl vs. the Blob", "url": "http://www.wsj.com/articles/primary-preview-the-brawl-vs-the-blob-1450399034", "topics": ["Personality", "Foreign Policy/National Security"], "people": ["Donald Trump", "Barry Goldwater", "Jeb Bush", "Hillary Clinton"], "orgs": ["Republican Party", "Democratic Party"], "election_confidence": 0.9262392923744104, "authors": [{"author_id": 1244, "fullname": "peggy noonan", "primary_org": "wsj"}], "date_written": "2015-12-18 00:37:17", "org": "wsj", "article_id": "f737b6cbe73bd8be0b6515a58e577073", "date_access": "2015-12-18 02:47:20.122316"}]
